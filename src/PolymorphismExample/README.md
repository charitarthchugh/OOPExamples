#Polymorphism
###What is it?
Encapsulation simply is the idea of limiting access
###What does it mean for us?
This allows us to control usage and what variables can or can't be modified
##Situation
* We are a savings bank
* We allow a user to set whatever interest that they want & see a five year projection
* We also allow them to set any dollar amount for the projection
* At the same time we have a calculator that only uses a fixed interest(3%) and all the user has to do is enter a dollar value 
* As a costumer, you have compare and contrast these two to be more logical
 
Now to find out, run `Bank.java` & `BankUnlimited.java` (`Tip- also look at Savings.java & SavingsUnlimited.java!`,`Hint:Make sure that you look @ the \\comments!`)
